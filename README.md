# Kubernetes Helm Dashboard Powered by Devtron

![helm-readme-image](./assets/k8sdashboard.png)

## üìï Overview

Helm is one of the most adopted package managers for deploying applications to Kubernetes.
The intuitive Helm Dashboard offers a UI-driven approach for managing the lifecycle of Helm Applications, abstracting out all the complexities and challenges.

Through the dashboard, one can:

- Manage community and custom helm charts
- See manifest diff of past revisions
- Easily rollback or upgrade between different versions
- Seamlessly integrate and deploy multiple charts together using [Chart Groups](https://docs.devtron.ai/usage/deploy-chart/chart-group)

## üñ± Installation

Before you begin, you must create a [Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/create-cluster/) (preferably K8s 1.16 or higher) and install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

### Install Helm Dashboard Powered by Devtron

Run the following command to install the latest version of Devtron:

```bash
helm repo add devtron https://helm.devtron.ai
```
```bash
helm install devtron devtron/devtron-operator --create-namespace --namespace devtroncd
```

### Access the dashboard

**URL**: Use the following command to get the dashboard URL:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n devtroncd devtron-service -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress}'
```

### Credentials

**Username**:  `admin` <br>
**Password**:   Run the following command to get the admin password: 
1. For Devtron version **v0.6.0** and higher
```bash
kubectl -n devtroncd get secret devtron-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.ADMIN_PASSWORD}' | base64 -d
```
2. For Devtron version less than **v0.6.0**
```bash
kubectl -n devtroncd get secret devtron-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.ACD_PASSWORD}' | base64 -d
```

### Installation status

The above install command starts the **Devtron-operator**, which takes a couple of minutes to spin up all of the Devtron micro-services one by one. You may check the status of the installation with the following command:

```bash
kubectl -n devtroncd get installers installer-devtron \
-o jsonpath='{.status.sync.status}'
```

The command executes with one of the following output messages, indicating the status of the installation:

* **Downloaded**: The installer has downloaded all the manifests, and installation is in-progress.
* **Applied**: The installer has successfully applied all the manifests, and the installation is completed.

**Note:** For different installation methods and integrations, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.devtron.ai/getting-started/install/install-devtron-with-cicd)
